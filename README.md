# Game-Of-Life-raylib


<br><br>
This is a C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life using raylib for graphics. The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from human players. Players set up the initial configuration of cells on a grid, and then watch as generations evolve over time.

The project aims to provide an interactive experience, allowing users to visually explore the behavior of cellular automata through various patterns and configurations. Whether you're a seasoned programmer looking to experiment with raylib and cellular automata, or a beginner curious about the fascinating world of emergent complexity from simple rules, this tutorial offers something for everyone.

## How to run the program

<br>
- start the Simulation: Press Enter key to initiate the simulation. Observe as the cells transition through generations, adhering to the Game of Life's rules.
- Pause/Stop the Simulation: Hit the Spacebar to pause the simulation at any moment.
